			"When I think of inspiration I think of creativity and power, like how one person can create a whole new world for everyone else to see. Hayao Miyazaki is one of the worlds greatest animators and his talent has inspired millions with his wonderful artwork and storytelling. Miyazaki is most commonly known for his animation studio, Studio Ghibli, which has produced beloved and celebrated films recognized around the world. Totoro can whisk you into the hidden forest, while Haku will help you escape the spirits bathhouse, and Ponyo will enjoy a bowl of ramen with you. His art and stories have opened a new world of animation to the Western world, making him a global inspiration for his storytelling abilities."

		"Creative - they are artists and thinkers and dreamers, but mostly they create the revolution they want the world to see in whatever form they can express it"
