    <h2>Yoga</h2>
    <p>
      Flexibility and mobility play a role in every fitness regime, but yoga takes both those skills and turns it into a workout similar to art. The flow and delicate change from movement to movement in a flow can challenge your body and mind in new ways. However, yoga can seem too expensive or unavailable to beginners. That's where Yoga with Adriene comes in, Adriene teaches beginner to advanced flows all readily available on YouTube where the only thing you need is some open space and a connection. To get started with a super easy beginner flow, click the link below.

    <h2>Getting Crafty in the Kitchen</h2>
    <p>
      When I first moved into my own apartment I found out that I knew very little about cooking, especially about how broad and creative I could get in the kitchen. Until one day when scrolling through the endless feed on TikTok I met Lynja, an older woman whose goofy personality made the kitchen a more inviting space. Her fun recipes and test-recipes, but mostly her hilarious editing welcome any level of cook to the kitchen. Click the link below to get cooking with Lynja.

    <h2>Be a Podcast Pro</h2>
    <p>
        Long commutes, predictable storylines on TV, and trying to lower total screentime are all big factors that have driven people into the world of podcasts. With the ability to put one on and continue about your daily chores without wondering if you missed an important scene, podcasts can delve you into new worlds, give advice, or just tell you stories. The world of podcasts is vast and there's something for everyone, but I have currently been loving Anything Goes by Emma Chamberlain. Her fresh perspective and authentic personality make me feel like I'm listening to a friend. Clcik the link below to listen to her latest episode on good habits.
