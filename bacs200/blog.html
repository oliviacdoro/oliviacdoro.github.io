				<h1>&lt;California Plans to Clean Up Microplasticse&gt;</h1>
				<p>&lt;Microplastics — fragments of broken-down plastic no larger than a fraction of an inch — have become a colossal global problem. This problem more prevalent in the Golden State has caused the Ocean Protection Council to commit $3 million dollars this year to start tackling the problem. It is estimated that humans have manufactured about 8.3 million metric tons of plastic, while only 9% of that has been recycled. This causes about 11 million tons of plastic to end up in our oceans every year, and without intervention that 11 million is expected to triple by 2040. Meaning 33 million tons of plastic in our oceans every year. At the local level, California’s strategy primarily aims to do two things: First, prevent plastics from entering the environment. Second, monitor those that are already out there.&gt;</p>
