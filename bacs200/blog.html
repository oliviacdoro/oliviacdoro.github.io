				<h1>&lt;California Plans to Clean Up Microplasticse&gt;</h1>
				<p>&lt;Microplastics — fragments of broken-down plastic no larger than a fraction of an inch — have become a colossal global problem. This problem more prevalent in the Golden State has caused the Ocean Protection Council to commit $3 million dollars this year to start tackling the problem. It is estimated that humans have manufactured about 8.3 million metric tons of plastic, while only 9% of that has been recycled. This causes about 11 million tons of plastic to end up in our oceans every year, and without intervention that 11 million is expected to triple by 2040. Meaning 33 million tons of plastic in our oceans every year. At the local level, California’s strategy primarily aims to do two things: First, prevent plastics from entering the environment. Second, monitor those that are already out there.&gt;</p>

					<h2>Social Implications</h2>
					<p>&lt;The first step in California's plan is reducing or ultimately eliminating the worst culprits, including single-use plastics, synthetic fabrics, cigarette filters and car tires. The idea to start small will soon be common sense, especially as California leads the nation in environmental and sustainability protection efforts like ending the sale of gas cars by 2035. It is these small steps that will create a larger social impact, first in the U.S. and then beyond. The Earth is 71% water-covered, and the damage humanity has done has already left it's mark on ocean treasures like the Great Barrier Reef to now extinct ocean species. Removing plastic from the oceans is no longer the top priority for ocean ocnservation, but eliminating the need and use of single-use plastic is. California's initiative is tackling the perspective from a modern view and puts the most urgent needs first, which will help preserve the beauty of the ocean for everyone.&gt;</p>

					<h2>Environmental Implications</h2>
					<p>&lt;When these plastics break down, they can be eaten by marine animals, stunting their growth and causing reproductive problems. Ocean species are facing a faster extinction rate as fishing, finning, and other industries strip the seas of these natural creatures everyday. In order to protect the California native species and ocean wildlife the initiative plans to set goals to research where the majority of the microplastics are coming from, and how much risk each kind poses to the health of humans and aquatic life. This will allow for scientists and environmentalists to investigate the impacts of microplastics in our oceans and on ocean life.&gt;</p>

					<h2>Health Implications</h2>
					<p>&lt;While microplastics pose environmental risks, they also pose health risks to marine and human life. Though scientists agree that plastic pollution is a blight, little is known about exactly how it affects us. The plan also commits to monitoring levels of microplastics in California’s waters, just as the state monitors the level of harmful particulate matter in the air, which can often increase during events like wildfires. This initative will hopefully lead the charge to study and understand how harmful microplastics are and how to eliminate them by offering more sustainable and healthy alternatives.&gt;</p>

					<h2>Conclusion</h2>
					<p>&lt;In conclusion, California's initiative to clean up microplastics will not only lead the national efforts for a campaign like this but also begin vital research to the numerous implications for microplastic effects. The hope is that California — the state with the largest economy and among the best environmental protections in the nation — can forge ahead in reducing the harm of microplastics, even if it can’t solve the problem on its own&gt;</p>
