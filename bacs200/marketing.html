					<h2>Alpha Omicron Pi</h2>
					<p>Alpha Omicron Pi's greatest strength is our members; unique as individuals, yet bound together by the common bond of friendship. Bound by these ties of friendship, AOII encourages each member to recognize what is unique in each of us, to develop our individual talents and to be proud of our differences. As represented by one of our symbols, the sheaf of wheat, we are made stronger by coming together as one. As women of the Epsilon Gamma Chapter of Alpha Omicron Pi, we promise to strive to be our best by upholding our values and living our ritual by immersing ourselves in academic integrity, philanthropy, sisterhood, and Greek unity.</p>

				<section class="Alpha Phi" id="imp-aphi">
					<h2>Alpha Phi</h2>

We do our best to carry on the legacy that our founders created through elegance and grace. Alpha Phi encourages its members to reach her highest potential while enjoying the journey along the way. We strive to enhance each member’s development through sisterhood, love, scholarship, philanthropy/service, and loyalty. Friendships formed in Alpha Phi are genuine and lifelong. Alpha Phi also provides opportunities to gain and develop social, as well as professional skills. Each Alpha Phi is proud to wear our letters, and represent our house. We strive for excellence in all that we do, and along the way, we know that we have our sisters standing right behind us.</p>

					<h2>Alpha Sigma Alpha</h2>
					<p>ASA provides an opportunity to develop as a leader within the sisterhood and the UNC community. Joining committees, attending meetings, and learning the ASA way of life enrich sisters’ lives in many ways. ASA is committed to giving back to the community through fun events with Special Olympics such as bowling and basketball tournaments where sisters share the love with Special Olympians. We also partner with other Greek organizations to serve the UNC community and beyond.</p>

				<section class="Delta Zeta" id="imp-dz">
					<h2>Delta Zeta</h2>
					<p>Delta Zeta is one of the largest international sororities that strive to unite its members in the bonds of sincere and lasting friendship and to stimulate one another in the pursuit of knowledge. Delta Zeta is founded on its four ideals of purity, charity, truth, and loving kindness, and as members of a proud sorority, Delta Zeta's believe in portraying these attributes in our everyday life. The Delta Xi Chapter at UNC is very active in social events, philanthropic opportunities, and cherishes the sisterhood events that make our sorority so much fun to be a part of. Delta Zeta brings out the best in its members by providing leadership opportunities and allowing more chances to get involved on campus. Delta Zeta is more than a great organization, it is a home away from home where love and friendship last a lifetime.</p>
