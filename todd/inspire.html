			"When I think of inspiration I think of creativity and power, like how one person can create a whole new world for everyone else to see. Hayao Miyazaki is one of the worlds greatest animators and his talent has inspired millions with his wonderful artwork and storytelling. Miyazaki is most commonly known for his animation studio, Studio Ghibli, which has produced beloved and celebrated films recognized around the world. Totoro can whisk you into the hidden forest, while Haku will help you escape the spirits bathhouse, and Ponyo will enjoy a bowl of ramen with you. His art and stories have opened a new world of animation to the Western world, making him a global inspiration for his storytelling abilities."

		<p> The people I most admire inspire those around them by: </p>
		<ul>
		<li>
		: :
		"Bold - they create and speak without fear because they know what they're creating is more important than the backlash they could face"
		</li>
		<li>
		"Creative - they are artists and thinkers and dreamers, but mostly they create the revolution they want the world to see in whatever form they can express it"
		</li>
		<li>
		“Impactful – they make their audiences feel something and more importantly they drive people to action”
		</li>
		<li>
		“Rememberable – they create a following and impact that people remember well past their mortal life”
		</li>
		<li>
		“Driven – they have the internal motivation to push forward and follow their dreams despite the natural hardships of life”
		</li>
	</ul>

	“In the world of animators and storytelling innovators Hayao Miyazaki sits close to Walt Disney in the Eastern realm of animation. His whimsical artwork whisked millions onto fantastical adventures, all tied to the real-world issues we face. Children were fascinated with the imaginative creatures, while adults were wowed by the underlying messages delivered in a beautiful moving picture. His stories and art have inspired artists to philosophers on the importance of nature in our world and leaving a legacy both impactful and beautiful. To me his life and art are the most inspiring and beautiful message on how to create for the greater good.”
